In order to use this file you need to run a denarii daemon and a denarii wallet rpc server. Assuming you already have
them you can run the following commands.

```
./denariid
```

Make sure you are storing all your wallets in /denarii/wallet

```
./denarii-wallet-rpc-server --rpc-bind-port=8080 --wallet-dir="/denarii/wallet" --disable-rpc-login
```
